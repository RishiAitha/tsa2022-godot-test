**TSA 2023 Video Game Design Project**

||---------------------------------------------------------------||

Current Known Issues (commented where location of issue is known):

 - "opposite tile check" to see whether or not to run flip to kill is failing and switching to revive for some unknown reason
	 - (or could be an issue with displaying the wrong buttons)

||---------------------------------------------------------------||

To-Do:

 - Add comments to code
 - Implement game over
 - Start menu (maybe choosing amount of players)
 - Make functions and instance vars more organized, delete excess
 - Sprites and animation
 - Add comments to code (again, I'll probably forget)
 - Lots of testing & bug fixes
 - Change testing values to release values
