||---------------------------------------------------------------||

Current Known Issues (commented where location of issue is known):

 - none! (for now)

||---------------------------------------------------------------||

To-Do:

 - Start menu (maybe choosing amount of players)
 - Make functions and instance vars more organized, delete excess
 - Sprites and animation
 - Add comments to code (again, I'll probably forget)
 - Lots of testing & bug fixes
 - Change testing values to release values
